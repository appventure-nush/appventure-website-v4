  This project was developed as a NUSH version of Wordle. However, it is more like a variant of Wordle known as Worldle. Everyday there is a new secret locations that players must figure out. Players must guess places in NUS High school such as the lower auditorium or computer lab 1 and with every guess, the proximity between the guess and the true secret place is displayed. Every day, the player is allowed 6 guesses. It is a unique and enriching way to learn more about the school.
