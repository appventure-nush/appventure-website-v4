  Knock Knock is a secure messaging application. It uses end-to-end encryption like other apps (e.g. WhatsApp) so no one can read your messages. It has contact hiding to hide contacts from others on your phone, using rhythm-based Knock Codes™. It prevents spam. It sends HD pictures. It looks cool. It’s Knock Knock.
