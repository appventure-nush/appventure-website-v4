## Some Gotchas

1. When linking images, use PNGs or SVGs, JPEGs and BMPs don't work sometimes.
1. Link images with a relative filepath with a dot as such: `![My image][./image.png]`. 

## Contributor profile

Sample contributor entry:

`content/contributors/contributors.yaml`
```yaml
...
- id: johndoe
  name: John Doe
  bio: A little bit about yourself
  quote: one fish, two fish, red fish, blue fish
  avatar: ./images/johndoe.png # will be replaced with boringavatars.com if unspecified
...
```

## Blog posts

Sample markdown file preamble:

`index.md`
```yaml
title: Say hello to Gridsome ðŸ‘¶ðŸŽ‰ðŸ’š
slug: 2014-01-01-say-hello-to-gridsome
author: [hjvedvik]
date: 2018-10-10
excerpt: "A new static site generator baby is born. It's highly inspired by Gatsby.js (React based) but built on top of Vue.js. We have been working on it for a year and will have a beta ready soon. You can expect this baby to grow up fast!"
